# Awesome Observability

Monitoring as defined by the Oxford dictionary is to "Observe and check the progress or quality of (something) over a period of time; keep under systematic review".

For systems monitoring that means being able to give an overview over the state of a system by exposing key metrics about the systems. The monitoring can be implemented in different ways:

 * one can push metrics from a service,
 * pull metrics from it or
 * use a combined hybrid approach

Furthermore, the concept of __observability__ can be seen a superset of monitoring where it is a part of giving visibility into the system. Providing the  ability to reason about the system health in a better way.

It can be said to  consist of three parts:

 * __event logs__ (can be in different forms, plain text, structured or binary and is in general about having a log about what happened at a certain time),
 * __metrics__ (measurement over time, for example number of failed requests) and
 * __tracing__ (represent related and distributed events together as a request flows through a system)

> __Metrics__, __Logs__ and __Traces__: The Golden Triangle of Observability in Monitoring

This repo is not only for monitoring. As said Adrian Cole’s in the talk about "[Observability 3 Ways](https://www.dotconferences.com/2017/04/adrian-cole-observability-3-ways-logging-metrics-tracing)" we are going to focus on the three types of systems necessaries to understand how your applications behave: Logging, Metrics & Tracing.

## 1. Best Practices

 * [Best practices for monitoring cloud applications](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/monitoring)
 * [The Three Pillars of Observability](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/distributed-systems-observability/9781492033431/ch04.html)

## 2. General Tools

Before to start with huge observability solution. If you just need to control some application aspects, visualize how is working your system, or just identify a problem, may be usefull start with one, or a collection application, that help you to get this information in a __easy__ and __cheap__ way.

Additional to this, start with tools to get information about your system to determine if it's working well, can help you to define the final stack if you want to install a corporative solution to any project. I know some stories abot people that install, configure and even evolution some monitoring tools as a corporative solution, an when the solution is in production, they realize that the tools don't cover all the necessaries to control their applications :-D

Following you can see an interesting post from Netflix writteb by [Brendan Gregg](http://www.brendangregg.com/) that show this very clear.

https://netflixtechblog.com/linux-performance-analysis-in-60-000-milliseconds-accc10403c55

In the article you can see how with a few tools and in a short time, you can get a lot of information about your system ;-)

```
 $ uptime
 $ dmesg | tail
 $ vmstat 1
 $ mpstat -P ALL 1
 $ pidstat 1
 $ iostat -xz 1
 $ free -m
 $ sar -n DEV 1
 $ sar -n TCP,ETCP 1
 $ top
```

There are many more commands and methodologies you can apply to drill deeper.
